# landing-page

# Overview
# This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and allows me to practice building a landing page from a provided design while improving my web development skills. The goal is to enhance my understanding of HTML, CSS, layout techniques, and responsive design by copying the structure and styling as closely as possible.

# Future Improvements
- Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes and better semantic HTML.
- Optimize performance by reducing redundant CSS and compressing images.
- Enhance responsiveness with media queries and flexible layouts.
- Experiment with animations and hover effects for a better user experience.
- Implement a simple navigation menu with interactive elements.
- Deepen my understanding of design consistency, spacing, and typography.
  
# This project is a stepping stone in my journey to becoming a better full-stack web developer by applying my knowledge to a real-world-style project.
